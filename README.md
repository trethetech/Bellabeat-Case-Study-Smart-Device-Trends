# **3. Data Sources and Limitations**

**Data Sources**

The primary dataset used for this case study is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, made publicly available on Kaggle by Mobius under a CC0: Public Domain license. This dataset contains anonymized personal fitness tracker data collected from 30 Fitbit users over a 31-day period. Participants consented to the submission of their data, which includes daily records of physical activity, step counts, calories burned, and sleep metrics.

The dataset is organized across multiple CSV files, each representing different aspects of smart device usage. For this analysis, the focus is placed on daily-level data, as it is most appropriate for identifying high-level behavioral trends relevant to marketing strategy.

The primary files used include:

* dailyActivity_merged.csv — Provides daily summaries of steps, activity intensity, and calories burned.
* sleepDay_merged.csv — Contains daily sleep duration and time-in-bed metrics.

**Data Location and Accessibility**

The dataset is hosted directly on Kaggle and accessed through a Kaggle Notebook environment. All data files are stored in a read-only directory provided by Kaggle, ensuring version control, reproducibility, and consistent access throughout the analysis. No local storage or manual file handling was required.

**Licensing, Privacy, and Security Considerations**

The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data is released under a CC0 public domain license, allowing unrestricted use for analysis and presentation. All records are anonymized, and no personally identifiable information is included. As a result, the dataset presents no known privacy, security, or ethical risks and is appropriate for educational and portfolio use.

**Data Credibility and Limitations**

While the dataset is suitable for exploratory analysis, it has several important limitations that must be acknowledged:

* Sample Size: The dataset includes data from only 30 users, which limits statistical generalizability.
* Lack of Demographics: No demographic information (e.g., age, gender, geographic location) is available, preventing segmentation analysis.
* Temporal Relevance: The data was collected in 2016 and may not fully reflect current smart device usage behaviors.
* Third-Party Source: The data was not collected directly by Bellabeat, which may introduce differences between Fitbit users and Bellabeat customers.
